    <h1>Individual Project</h1>
    <h2>Author: Opeyemi Faronbi</h2>
    <p>
    A single-page application (SPA) style web application to search and display details of books. 
    The data and service are provided by Google Books.
The individual project is the foundation of our project-based learning approach in this class. 
It will be completed in four cumulative milestones corresponding to the class schedule. The requirements of 
each milestone will be posted as we progress according to schedule. The four milestones are:
<ol>
    <li>Design web pages to display book data coded in the JSON format</li>
    <li>Search and get book information from the Google Books web API</li>
    <li>Complete major operations in the AJAX/AJAJ way</li>
    <li>Improve the page design with better SPA UI designs</li>
</ol>
Each milestone requires that you complete relevant readings and lab work first. The milestones will go a little beyond lectures and labs, so you may have to do some research and experiments on your own to complete them.
